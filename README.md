# Unity Screenshot Taker Tool
A Screenshot taker unity tool using the Window Editor to capture screenshots of the game view and save them in whatever path you want by creating one in the Unity Project.
- To use go to Window -->Screenshot Taker UnityEditor.
- You can add the path you desire, I recommend to use Assets/ "Your Folder"  and save it in the path you want.
- You can also add a name to the screenshot.
- The screenshot is always being saved as a .png file.
- By pressing the take screenshot button the screenshot is being taken but because asset database can be a bit slow i would recommend to click refresh
- You can download the Unity Package and add it into your Project on Itch.io: (https://itchiovp.itch.io/screenshot-taker-unity-tool)
